# Visualization for simplex algorithm

A Python library to look at a linear optimization problem.

Objectives :
- intuition about the shape of the feasible region (spoiler: it is a [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope))
- visualization of the feasible region behaviour during sensitivity analysis

# Test it now with binder !

# How to use the notebook

Run the cells with shift + enter. You can move the plot and use the widget to interact.

For the sensitivity analysis, only use change the profit for B.

There is a bug in the notebook, if the plot is not interactive, re-run the cell (shift + enter).
