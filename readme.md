# Visualization for simplex algorithm

A Python library to look at a linear optimization problem.

Objectives :
- intuition about the shape of the feasible region (spoiler: it is a [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope))
- visualization of the feasible region behaviour during sensitivity analysis
